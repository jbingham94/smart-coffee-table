"Smart Coffee Table" 

General Description:

	The smart coffee table is your personal dashboard for getting in touch with frequently used personal applications in an easy-to-use, beverage-friendly table interface. Users can read email, news, weather reports, and time from a centralized location and supplement watching the morning news and coffee with other useful imformation that can better prepare him or her for the day ahead.

Testing Methodology: 

	We will test the initial progress report for our Smart Coffee Table application by combining the display/graphics functionality with the email and weather readings to form an initial prototyped graphical display. 

	Once the display is functioning properly as a stand alone application, we will connect the buttons for the raspberry by to get dimming/activiating functionality.
